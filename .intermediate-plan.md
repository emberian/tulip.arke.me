  Ideas for Enhancement:

  1. Dice Rolling / Randomization
    - Built-in /roll command with notation like 2d6+3
    - Visible random results for games
    - Could be a standard built-in, not just a bot
  2. Character Profiles / Sheets
    - Users could have multiple character identities they switch between
    - Similar to puppeting but for actual users
    - Character sheets that can be viewed and potentially edited
  3. Scene/Setting Features
    - Topic banners with images or setting descriptions
    - "The scene is..." pinned context at top of topic
    - Channel-wide ambient descriptions
  4. Action Formatting
    - italics for actions style rendering with distinct styling
    - /me command with special formatting
    - Maybe narrative vs dialogue formatting
  5. Turn-Based Systems
    - Turn order indicators
    - Status display showing whose turn it is instead of just "typing..."
    - Initiative trackers for combat or structured scenes
  6. Reaction Enhancements
    - More custom emoji support
    - Animated reactions
    - Reaction roles/effects
  7. Private Notes / GM Whispers
    - Built-in "GM" role concept
    - Quick whisper to single person shortcuts
    - Scene notes only visible to GM
  8. Timeline/Thread Features
    - "Flashback" markers
    - Parallel timeline channels
    - Cross-references between scenes
  9. Character Mentions
    - @puppet mentions that notify the controlling bot/user
    - Ways to tag specific character identities across the server

  , though typeahead already handles puppets—the question is how notifications route to the right person. Message styling options like dialogue vs.
  narration vs. OOC formatting, custom CSS per channel, and ambient themes for different moods. Voice integration with ambient sounds and text-to-speech for
   narration. Interactive maps with character positioning and location-based channels. Persistent inventory and state tracking like health bars and shared
  world state. Anonymous posting modes with mod verification. In-universe time and date systems.

  The time system could track passage with markers and day/night cycles. OOC handling needs clear visual distinction and the ability to toggle it off during
   serious scenes. Message edit tracking should show when someone edits, with optional restrictions in certain channels to preserve narrative integrity.

⏺ This is a delightfully comprehensive set of features for roleplay and creative chaos! Let me summarize what you have and brainstorm what could take it to the next level.

  Ideas for Maximum Hooliganry

  1. Dice & Randomization (Built-in)

  A native /roll 2d6+3 that doesn't require a bot—shows animated dice and results inline. Maybe with exploding dice, advantage/disadvantage, hidden GM rolls.

  2. Action/Narrative Formatting

  - *asterisk text* renders with distinct "action" styling (not just italics)
  - /me draws their sword with special formatting
  - Maybe >greentext for narration or quotation styling
  - ((double parens)) for OOC with muted styling

  3. Character Switcher (User-side Puppeting)

  Let regular users have multiple personas—click their avatar to switch who they're "speaking as." Each persona has its own name, avatar, color. The real user is still visible on hover.

  4. Scene/Setting Banners

  Topic-level pinned "scene description" with optional image—appears at the top of the topic. Set by GM or anyone with permission. Could include ambient info ("The tavern is noisy, rain patters outside").

  5. Turn Tracker

  Widget or sidebar showing whose turn it is. Could integrate with initiative rolls. Visual indicator next to the active player's messages.

  6. Quick Whisper Gestures

  - Click someone's name → opens whisper compose to just them
  - "Whisper to sender" button on received whispers (you have this!)
  - Maybe: whisper chains that continue automatically

  7. Anonymous/Masked Mode

  Post as "Anonymous" or "A Masked Figure" with real identity visible only to admins/GMs. Good for mysteries, confessions, werewolf games.

  8. Reaction Roles / Reaction Effects

  Reactions that trigger bot events—vote with reactions, RSVP, claim items. "React with ⚔️ to join the battle."

  9. Persistent State API

  Bot API for storing per-user, per-channel state. Health bars, inventory, reputation scores. Display as badges or indicators next to names.

  10. Message Themes/Modes

  Per-channel setting for "RP mode" that changes styling—darker theme, different fonts, hides timestamps, etc. "Serious mode" that hides OOC.

  11. Flashback/Timeline Markers

  :::flashback blocks for narrative non-linearity. Maybe visual timeline in the sidebar showing scene order vs. chronological order.

  12. Sound/Music Triggers

  Bots can send audio_url that plays for everyone in the channel. Ambient sounds, dramatic stings, fanfares.

  13. Puppet Mentions & Notifications

  @mentioning a puppet notifies the controlling bot/user. Already in typeahead—does it route notifications correctly?

  14. Private Topic Threads

  Topics that only certain users can see—like whispers but for whole conversation threads within a channel.

  15. Custom Emoji Packs

  Per-channel or per-game emoji sets. Upload a pack and they're available only in that context.

  Quick Wins (Lower Effort, High Fun)

  1. Built-in /roll - Everyone needs dice
  2. OOC wrapper syntax ((like this)) with muted styling
  3. Action syntax *like this* with distinct non-italic styling
  4. Whisper reply shortcut - You have this, just highlighting it's great
  5. "Speaking as" dropdown for user personas

  Bigger Projects (High Impact)

  1. Character switcher - Users want to be multiple people
  2. Scene banners - Visual scene-setting
  3. Persistent state API - Game bots need memory
  4. Anonymous posting mode - Essential for certain games
